# DERA: Dense Entity Retrieval for Entity Alignment

DERA is a dense entity retrieval framework for EA, leveraging language models to uniformly encode various features of entities and facilitate nearest entity search across KGs. Candidate alignments are first generated through entity retrieval, which are subsequently reranked to determine the final alignments.

## Installation

Ensure your Python version is 3.6 or higher. Run the following commands to install the project in development mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YiMingGuan/DERA.git
cd aligncraft
pip install -e .
```

------

## Project Preparation

You can download all the required **datasets** from the following link:

ðŸ“‚ **[Download Datasets ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UEWVpLEnnnVmf6tofsNS1GwmtjCflKp1/view?usp=sharing)**

After downloading, extract the contents and place them into the `benchmark` directory. Make sure the paths in the configuration files point to the correct dataset locations before running the pipeline.

## Quick Start

DERA is structured into a three-stage pipeline:

1. **Entity Verbalization**: Transforms knowledge graph triples into natural language entity descriptions.
2. **Entity Retrieval**: Encodes textual descriptions into embeddings and retrieves top-k similar entities.
3. **Alignment Reranking**: Refines the alignment results through an interaction-based reranking model.

All full pipeline scripts are located in:

```
aligncraft/examples/retrievalea/pipeline/
```

To run the complete DERA pipeline on the `DBP15K fr-en` dataset:

```bash
bash aligncraft/examples/retrievalea/pipeline/attr/pipeline_fr_en.sh
```

- `aligncraft/examples/retrievalea/logs/`: Logs for each pipeline step
- `aligncraft/examples/retrievalea/config/`: YAML configuration files for each language pair
